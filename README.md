Quiz Instructions:

When you start the quiz, you're presented a question with possible answer choices. A timer will start counting down from 56 (a reference to the story's protagonist). When you answer correctly, you'll receive one point, and your timer will increase by 10 seconds. Answer wrong, and the timer will decrease by 10 seconds. Once you've answered all questions, or the timer runs out, the quiz will end. Your final score will be total of how many questions your got right in addition to how many seconds are left on the timer.

Your score will be saved to your browser's local storage, which can be viewed using the Leaderboard button when not taking the quiz.

Assets:

The quiz is primarily built on JavaScript logic, with a separate .jS file containing all questions, answers, and answer keys.
